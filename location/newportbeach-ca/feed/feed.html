In no case does MAI pay a fee to be considered for an award to participate in rankings. Further, MAI is not required to be a subscriber to Forbes to be included in their rankings or awards. Forbes Top Next-Gen Wealth Advisors: The Forbes Next-Gen Wealth Advisors rankings, developed by SHOOK Research, is based on an algorithm of qualitative criterion, mostly gained through telephone and in-person due diligence interviews, and quantitative data. Those advisors that are considered have a minimum of four years’ experience and the algorithm weighs factors like revenue trends, assets under management, compliance records, industry experience and those that encompass the highest standards of best practices. Portfolio performance is not a criterion due to varying client objectives and lack of audited date. Neither Forbes nor SHOOK receive a fee in exchange for rankings.</p> <p>The post <a href="../../../andrew-meyer.html">Andrew Meyer, CFP®, CFA</a> appeared first on <a href="../../../mai_default_4.html">MAI Capital Management</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>team/andrew-meyer/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item> <title>Frank Sanchez, CFP®, ChFC®, RICP®, AIF®</title> <link>team/frank-sanchez/</link> <comments>team/frank-sanchez/#respond</comments> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Kerry Marinchick]]></dc:creator> <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 08:59:51 +0000</pubDate> <guid isPermaLink="false">http://mai.capital/?post_type=team&#038;p=1696</guid> <description><![CDATA[<p>Designations CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional Chartered Financial Consultant® Retirement Income Certified Professional® Accredited Investment Fiduciary® &#160; Work Experience Joined MAI in 2020, bringing 25 years of industry experience Was a Wealth Financial Advisor at Bank of the West where he worked with high-net-worth individuals and business owners focusing on financial planning, investment planning, portfolio management, [&#8230;]</p> <p>The post <a href="../../../frank-sanchez.html">Frank Sanchez, CFP®, ChFC®, RICP®, AIF®</a> appeared first on <a href="../../../mai_default_4.html">MAI Capital Management</a>.</p> ]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Designations</b></p> <ul> <li>CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> professional</li> <li>Chartered Financial Consultant®</li> <li>Retirement Income Certified Professional®</li> <li>Accredited Investment Fiduciary®</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Work Experience </b></p> <ul> <li>Joined MAI in 2020, bringing 25 years of industry experience</li> <li>Was a Wealth Financial Advisor at Bank of the West where he worked with high-net-worth individuals and business owners focusing on financial planning, investment planning, portfolio management, estate planning, and insurance strategies</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Life </b><b>Outside of MAI </b></p> <ul> <li>Live in Orange County with his wife, Gina, where they enjoy spending their time with friends, family, and traveling</li> <li>Active within his church and community volunteering at various charities</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Education</b></p> <ul> <li>University of California, Santa Barbara, BA in Business Economics</li> </ul> <p>The post <a href="../../../frank-sanchez.html">Frank Sanchez, CFP®, ChFC®, RICP®, AIF®</a> appeared first on <a href="../../../mai_default_4.html">MAI Capital Management</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>team/frank-sanchez/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
