Information provided is based 6/30/22. Forbes’ Best-In-State, developed by SHOOK Research, is based on an algorithm of qualitative criteria and quantitative data. Considered advisors have a minimum of seven years of experience, and the algorithm weighs factors like revenue trends, assets under management, compliance records, industry experience and those that encompass best practices in their practices and approach to working with clients. Portfolio performance is not a criterion due to varying client objectives and lack of audited data. Research summary (as of April 2023): 39,007 nominations received based on high thresholds and qualifications, 22,243 invited to complete online survey, 17,546 telephone interviews, 3,557 in-person interviews at advisors&#8217; location, and 1,361 web-based interviews.</p> <p>The post <a href="../../../albie-macdonald.html">Albie MacDonald, CFP®</a> appeared first on <a href="../../../mai_default_4.html">MAI Capital Management</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>team/albie-macdonald/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item> <title>Jordan Nightingale, CFP®, CPWA®</title> <link>team/jordan-nightingale/</link> <comments>team/jordan-nightingale/#respond</comments> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Kerry Marinchick]]></dc:creator> <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 09:56:22 +0000</pubDate> <guid isPermaLink="false">?post_type=team&#038;p=1804</guid> <description><![CDATA[<p>Designations CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional Certified Private Wealth Advisor® consultant &#160; Work Experience Joined the firm in 2021, brining 11 years of wealth management experience to MAI Helps clients achieve their financial goals by conducting comprehensive financial planning and portfolio management, with an emphasis on tax planning, estate planning, and risk management Was a Wealth [&#8230;]</p> <p>The post <a href="../../../jordan-nightingale.html">Jordan Nightingale, CFP®, CPWA®</a> appeared first on <a href="../../../mai_default_4.html">MAI Capital Management</a>.</p> ]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Designations</b></p> <ul> <li>CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> professional</li> <li>Certified Private Wealth Advisor® consultant</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Work Experience </b></p> <ul> <li>Joined the firm in 2021, brining 11 years of wealth management experience to MAI</li> <li>Helps clients achieve their financial goals by conducting comprehensive financial planning and portfolio management, with an emphasis on tax planning, estate planning, and risk management</li> <li>Was a Wealth Advisor at WJ Interests, LLC where he was responsible for leading all financial planning activities for the firm</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Life </b><b>Outside of MAI </b></p> <ul> <li>Active volunteer throughout the Ponte Vedra community and within his church</li> <li>Jordan and his wife, Samantha, share two children, Scott and Isabella</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Education</b></p> <ul> <li>Texas Tech University, BBA in Economics, MS in Personal Financial Planning</li> <li>Yale School of Management, Executive Education program in Wealth Management Theory &amp; Practice</li> </ul> <p>The post <a href="../../../jordan-nightingale.html">Jordan Nightingale, CFP®, CPWA®</a> appeared first on <a href="../../../mai_default_4.html">MAI Capital Management</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>team/jordan-nightingale/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item> <title>Katherine Perkner</title> <link>team/katherine-perkner/</link> <comments>team/katherine-perkner/#respond</comments> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Kerry Marinchick]]></dc:creator> <pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2023 19:36:45 +0000</pubDate> <guid isPermaLink="false">?post_type=team&#038;p=5821</guid> <description><![CDATA[<p>The post <a href="../../../katherine-perkner.html">Katherine Perkner</a> appeared first on <a href="../../../mai_default_4.html">MAI Capital Management</a>.</p> ]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The post <a href="../../../katherine-perkner.html">Katherine Perkner</a> appeared first on <a href="../../../mai_default_4.html">MAI Capital Management</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>team/katherine-perkner/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
