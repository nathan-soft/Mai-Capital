Considered advisors have a minimum of seven years of experience, and the algorithm weighs factors like revenue trends, assets under management, compliance records, industry experience and those that encompass best practices in their practices and approach to working with clients. Portfolio performance is not a criterion due to varying client objectives and lack of audited data. Research summary (as of April 2023): 39,007 nominations received based on high thresholds and qualifications, 22,243 invited to complete online survey, 17,546 telephone interviews, 3,557 in-person interviews at advisors&#8217; location, and 1,361 web-based interviews.</p> <p>The post <a href="../../../albie-macdonald.html">Albie MacDonald, CFP®</a> appeared first on <a href="../../../mai_default_4.html">MAI Capital Management</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://mai.capital/team/albie-macdonald/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item> <title>Joe McLean</title> <link>https://mai.capital/team/joe-mclean/</link> <comments>https://mai.capital/team/joe-mclean/#respond</comments> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Kerry Marinchick]]></dc:creator> <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 10:55:45 +0000</pubDate> <guid isPermaLink="false">http://mai.capital/?post_type=team&#038;p=1834</guid> <description><![CDATA[<p>Work Experience Provides planning and investment advisory services to professional athletes, entertainers, and entrepreneurs Prior to joining MAI in 2022, was a Managing Partner of Intersect Capital Clients include Academy Award winners, NFL and NBA World Champions, MLB All-Stars, and notable PGA golfers Known as the Money Whisperer in NBA circles, has played a leading [&#8230;]</p> <p>The post <a href="../../../joe-mclean.html">Joe McLean</a> appeared first on <a href="../../../mai_default_4.html">MAI Capital Management</a>.</p> ]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Work Experience </b></p> <ul> <li>Provides planning and investment advisory services to professional athletes, entertainers, and entrepreneurs</li> <li>Prior to joining MAI in 2022, was a Managing Partner of Intersect Capital</li> <li>Clients include Academy Award winners, NFL and NBA World Champions, MLB All-Stars, and notable PGA golfers</li> <li>Known as the Money Whisperer in NBA circles, has played a leading role in high-profile deals including one of the largest shoe contracts in the NBA, the creation and launch of Slow Grind Media, and the establishment of leading wine brand Diamond &amp; Key</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Life </b><b>Outside of MAI </b></p> <ul> <li>Serves on the board of trustees for the Special Olympics of Northern California, the Thompson Family Foundation, and the Gordon Family Giving Foundation</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Education</b></p> <ul> <li>University of Arizona, MBA</li> </ul> <p>The post <a href="../../../joe-mclean.html">Joe McLean</a> appeared first on <a href="../../../mai_default_4.html">MAI Capital Management</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://mai.capital/team/joe-mclean/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
