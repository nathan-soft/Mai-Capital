If you can keep those key points in mind, it is much easier to recognize that bear markets (a sustained stretch when investment prices are falling) are not likely to ruin retirements long-term \u2013 but bad investor behavior can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Fear of Running Out of Money in Retirement<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people have concerns about running out of money in retirement because financial planning involves adequate savings and participation in the markets. The markets are inherently volatile and may be unpredictable. These concerns may cause fears about what a bear market will do to a retiree\u2019s portfolio, like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Avoiding a falling market is important to achieve investment success.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Making changes to a portfolio before the market worsens is necessary to meet goals.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A bear market will ruin retirement portfolio.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a>But, these concerns may be reduced by properly managing the combination of net assets and spending, which are usually significant parts of a good retirement plan.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the hypothetical case of a retiree managing their own money in a tax-deferred account on a total return basis whose working career ended in December 1999:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Age 65, Plan to age 95<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>60\/40 portfolio (60% stocks using the S&amp;P 500 Index<sup>1<\/sup> as a proxy and 40% bonds using the US Aggregate Bond Index<sup>2<\/sup> as a proxy), rebalanced annually<sup>3<\/sup><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>4% initial withdrawal rate, then adjusted annually for inflation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A retirement that started in December 1999 took place in one of the worst extended periods of stock market performance in American history. Recall the S&amp;P 500 was cut in half \u2013 not once but <em><u>twice<\/u><\/em> \u2013 in the next nine years. And after 13 years, the price of the S&amp;P 500 was <em><u>lower<\/u><\/em> than at the start of retirement (See Exhibit 1).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><sup>1<\/sup>The Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (S&amp;P 500) is a broad index that is neither a specific investment nor a group of investments and cannot be invested in directly. Rather it is an unmanaged group of securities considered to be representative of the stock market in general. It is a market value weighted index with each stock&#8217;s weight in the index proportionate to its market value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><sup>2<\/sup>The Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index is a market capitalization-weighted index that is neither a specific investment nor a group of investments and cannot be invested in directly. Rather, the securities in the index are weighted according to the market size of each bond type. Most U.S. traded investment grade bonds are represented. Municipal bonds and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities are excluded, due to tax treatment issues. The index includes Treasury securities, Government agency bonds, Mortgage-backed bonds, corporate bonds, and a small amount of foreign bonds traded in U.S. The Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index is an intermediate term index.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><sup>3<\/sup>Rebalancing can entail transaction costs and tax consequences that should be considered when determining a rebalancing strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exhibit 1: The S&amp;P 500 Index from December 31, 1999 through December 31, 2012<sup>1<\/sup><\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"http:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Picture1-1024x439.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6321 lazyload\"\/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"439\" src=\"http:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Picture1-1024x439.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6321 lazyload\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Picture1-1024x439.gif 1024w, https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Picture1-300x129.gif 300w, https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Picture1-768x330.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/noscript><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That retiree is now 88 years old.&nbsp; Did the portfolio serve the retiree\u2019s needs by allowing inflation-adjusted withdrawals to support the retiree\u2019s lifestyle?
