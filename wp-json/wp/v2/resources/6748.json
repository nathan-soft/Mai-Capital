In 2024, beneficiaries of these plans will be able to rollover up to $35,000 tax-free into a Roth IRA (subject to certain limitations). Most states exclude these plan distributions from taxable income and many offer a state income tax deduction or state income tax credit.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Low Maintenance<\/td><td>529 plans can be opened online or through a licensed financial advisor and can even be set to an automated investment plan, with a program manager handling ongoing investment management.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>High Contribution Limits<\/td><td>529 plans have no annual contribution limits and high aggregate limits.
