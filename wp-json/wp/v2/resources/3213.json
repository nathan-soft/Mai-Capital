The firm was named as an honoree of the 2022 Northeast Ohio Pillar Award for Community Service for the third consecutive year, and Managing Partner Rick Buoncore was named the winner of the 2022 Kent Clapp CEO Leadership Award.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Under Buoncore\u2019s leadership, MAI created three pillars: take care of clients, take care of each other, and take care of the community. These principles shine through everything that MAI team does, day in and day out. Buoncore and the rest of the leadership team encourage a spirit of service among employees by planning group volunteer opportunities each year and encouraging their support of causes that are personal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCongratulations to our Ohio MAI team members for the recognition of their dedication and giving attitudes,\u201d said Rick Buoncore, Managing Partner of MAI Capital. \u201cOn a personal note, I\u2019m humbled to be honored with the Leadership Award. I owe a debt of gratitude to my team at MAI for their continued commitment to our firm, clients, and community.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through its 25 years, Medical Mutual, along with co-founding partner Smart Business, has recognized organizations and individuals whose efforts have made a significant impact in their communities through giving back. The Medical Mutual Pillar Award for Community Service is presented to for-profit businesses for their community service efforts, and the Kent Clapp CEO Leadership Award recognizes the top executive of a for-profit company for creating a culture of giving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to be eligible for the award, individuals are required to have a physical location in the 14-county region of Northeast Ohio (Ashland, Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Erie, Geauga, Huron, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, Stark, Summit, Tuscarawas, and Wayne).&nbsp; When determining honorees, the judges take into account charitable giving, volunteerism, pro bono work, and more. All of this year\u2019s honorees demonstrate their dedication to the Northeast Ohio community. The 2022 list highlights businesses of various disciplines and sizes that make outstanding contributions to their communities in Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati, Ohio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To view this year\u2019s lists, please visit:&nbsp; <a href=\"https:\/\/sbnonline.com\/article\/2022-pillar-award-for-community-service-northeast-ohio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>https:\/\/sbnonline.com\/article\/2022-pillar-award-for-community-service-northeast-ohio\/<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">MAI Capital was recognized as an Honoree of 2022 Smart Business, Medical Mutual Pillar Award for Community Service, and Rick Buoncore won the Kent Clapp CEO Leadership Award at the Medical Mutual Pillar Awards on 12\/1\/22.
