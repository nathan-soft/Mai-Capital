The following Covid related changes are no longer available:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The recovery rebates available as tax credits on 2020 and 2021 tax returns are not available in the 2022 tax year.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The expanded child tax credit (CTC) reverts to its pre-2021 amount worth up to $2,000 per child, with an earnings requirement and limited refundability of $1,500.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The child and dependent care tax credit (CDCTC) reverts from $8,000 in 2021 to $2,100 for the 2022 tax year.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The above-the-line charitable deduction worth up to $600 for joint filers is not available for the 2022 tax year, but the itemized deduction for charitable donations remains.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2023 Tax Filing Deadline<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The filing deadline to submit 2022 tax returns or an extension to file and pay tax owed is Tuesday, April 18, 2023, for most taxpayers. By law, Washington, D.C., holidays impact tax deadlines for everyone in the same way as federal holidays. The due date is April 18, instead of April 15, because of the weekend and the District of Columbia&#8217;s Emancipation Day holiday, which falls on Monday, April 17.&nbsp; Taxpayers requesting an extension will have until Monday, October 16, 2023, to file.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, please reach out to your MAI advisor if you have any questions about your specific tax situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">Authored by <a href=\"http:\/\/mai.capital\/about-us\/about-usour-team\/kathy-buchs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kathy Buchs, CPA, MT, Senior Tax Advisor &amp; Team Leader<\/a>, MAI Capital Management<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">Information updated as of 02.09.2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">Please send your questions, comments and feedback to: <a href=\"mailto:info@mai.capital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">info@mai.capital<\/a>.
