Remember, every time you put a dollar into a qualified plan on a pretax basis, it is one less dollar you are taxed at your top marginal tax bracket. This can be a significant tax benefit. Additionally, it\u2019s important to understand how your company match benefit is calculated. Is it done each payroll? At the end of the year? It\u2019s possible that if your company doesn\u2019t true up match contributions, you could potentially miss out on match dollars by reaching the contribution limit too early in the year.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For small business owners, understanding the contribution and benefit limits is crucial in limiting tax liability. Recently, we were consulting with a small business owner who had experienced a significant increase in revenue in 2022. We suggested that he consider a new Cash Balance Plan (hybrid Defined Benefit) and increase&nbsp; his compensation to the maximum limit.&nbsp; Based on his age, he can defer nearly $700k into the cash balance plan. If he does not adjust his compensation, his maximum deferral will be $360k. That\u2019s a significant tax savings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great example of why business owners should be working with an advisor who specializes in retirement plans.&nbsp; MAI Capital\u2019s Retirement division takes a customized approach to retirement plans, offering a complete and integrated platform that includes 401(k) services, fiduciary-based retirement plan consulting, and financial wellness programs for businesses, as well as tailored plans for individuals and families.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chart below outlines the announced IRS figures for retirement plans and other benefits, effective January 1, 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Annual Plan Limits<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>2023<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>2022<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>2021<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>2020<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Maximum Considered Compensation<\/td><td>$330,000<\/td><td>$305,000<\/td><td>$290,000<\/td><td>$285,000<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Limits on Benefits and Contributions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td>Defined Contribution Plans<\/td><td>$66,000<\/td><td>$61,000<\/td><td>$58,000<\/td><td>$57,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Defined Benefit Plans<\/td><td>$265,000<\/td><td>$245,000<\/td><td>$230,000<\/td><td>$230,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>401(k), 403(b), and 457 plan elective deferrals<\/td><td>$22,500<\/td><td>$20,500<\/td><td>$19,500<\/td><td>$19,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SIMPLE plan elective deferrals<\/td><td>$15,500<\/td><td>$14,000<\/td><td>$13,500<\/td><td>$13,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>IRA<\/td><td>$6,500<\/td><td>$6,000<\/td><td>$6,000<\/td><td>$6,000<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Catch-Up Contributions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td>401(k), 403(b), and 457 plans<\/td><td>$7,500<\/td><td>$6,500<\/td><td>$6,500<\/td><td>$6,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SIMPLE plans<\/td><td>$3,500<\/td><td>$3,000<\/td><td>$3,000<\/td><td>$3,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>IRA<\/td><td>$1,000<\/td><td>$1,000<\/td><td>$1,000<\/td><td>$1,000<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Health Savings Accounts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td>Individual contribution limit<\/td><td>$3,850<\/td><td>$3,650<\/td><td>$3,600<\/td><td>$3,550<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Family contribution limit<\/td><td>$7,750<\/td><td>$7,300<\/td><td>$7,200<\/td><td>$7,100<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Catch-up contributions<\/td><td>$1,000<\/td><td>$1,000<\/td><td>$1,000<\/td><td>$1,000<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Sources: IRS.gov and SHRM.org<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">Information updated as of 02.22.2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">Please send your questions, comments and feedback to: <a href=\"mailto:info@mai.capital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">info@mai.capital<\/a>.
