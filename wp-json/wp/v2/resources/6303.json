For many small business owners, the equity in their business and the income it generates comprise the bulk of the owner\u2019s estate and provide the means of support for the business owner\u2019s family. Upon the death or disability of the owner, many families are left scrambling to operate a business with which they are unfamiliar or unqualified to run, leading the to the eventual loss of customers and key employees. Ultimately, the owner\u2019s family may be stuck with a business that loses its value or becomes a financial burden to the family. Fortunately, proper <a href=\"http:\/\/mai.capital\/services\/\">business succession planning<\/a> can prevent this and provide an avenue to support the owner\u2019s heirs, whether through internal or external sale, continued operation by the family, or liquidation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Buy-Sell Agreement<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing a buy-sell agreement that sets the terms under which an owner\u2019s interest in the business should be sold, to whom, and at what price is a critical element of a successful business succession plan. An insurance backed buy-sell agreement used in conjunction with an irrevocable business acquisition trust that holds insurance policies on the owner\u2019s life provides even more security by ensuring immediate liquidity for the owner\u2019s family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Retention of Key Employees<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Many business owners want their business to continue if something happens to them. Unless the business is operated entirely by the family, it is often necessary to retain key employees to ensure its continued success. Offering phantom equity awards, profits interest equity purchase options, and key-man insurance are several ways to incentivize key employees to remain with the business and have an interest in its long-term success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Estate and Tax Planning Considerations<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When it becomes clear that a family business will have significant long-term value, business owners should consider transferring ownership interests in the business to one or more irrevocable trusts to remove appreciation from the owner\u2019s estate and implement multi-generational dynasty trust planning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Asset Protection<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Restructuring the business as a multi-member LLC can provide asset protection benefits. A corporation, whether taxed as an S or C corp., can easily convert to an LLC and maintain its original tax status.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Succession planning for a family business can be emotional and overwhelming, so it is important to seek professional advice. <a href=\"http:\/\/mai.capital\/contact-us\/\">Schedule a meeting<\/a> with an MAI Wealth Advisor to discuss the best strategies that will benefit you and your family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Source: Ivan &amp; Daugustinis Estate and Tax Attorneys \u2013 Information updated as of 10.4.23.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The opinions and analyses expressed herein are subject to change at any time.
