The addition of MTX expands MAI\u2019s footprint to the greater Washington, D.C. market, serving high-net-worth entrepreneurs and families, while also bolstering its growing specialty practice supporting athletes, coaches and professionals in the sports industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Located in Reston, Virginia, MTX is a full-service financial and investment advisor to high-net-worth individuals including professional athletes and entertainers. Under the leadership of Founder and President Steve Trax, CPA, CFP\u00ae, MTX has focused on providing exceptional service and support to its clientele. Trax will continue to oversee the office as MAI Regional Director.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMTX is founded on building deep and lasting relationships with clients, helping them reach their financial goals and ensuring they have a partner by their side. This is especially important in helping professional athletes navigate the distinct issues they encounter,\u201d says Rick Buoncore, Managing Partner at MAI. \u201cOur firm shares this philosophy and is excited to partner with MTX.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concurrent with the acquisition, MTX will consolidate the advisors who assist professional athletes and coaches into a dedicated service group within MAI, branded MAI Sports. MAI has its roots in serving sports-industry clients, as the firm was founded over 45 years ago on a \u201chandshake deal\u201d with legendary golfer Arnold Palmer. In the intervening years, MAI has grown to assisting over 1,200 clients, and has earned a reputation for helping athletes meet their financial goals. Trax will assume the role of Managing Director at MAI Sports, working alongside MAI\u2019s John Palguta, CPA, CFP\u00ae, Managing Director, to lead the firm\u2019s expanded sports-focused business unit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur client relationships are predicated on recognizing the passion and drive it takes our clients to achieve their career goals, and then matching that with our own dedication and understanding of how best to be stewards of their wealth,\u201d says Trax. \u201cMAI shares this approach in all areas of its business, but what truly sets the firm apart is its four-decade track record of earning the trust of athletes and delivering comprehensive financial planning services tailored to their needs.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis partnership underscores MAI\u2019s commitment to professionalizing the wealth management offering to the sports industry,\u201d says Sean Bresnan, Partner at Wealth Partners Capital Group (\u201cWPCG\u201d). \u201cWe are excited to expand MAI\u2019s presence into the D.C. market under the leadership of Steve and his team.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is MAI\u2019s third acquisition since taking a minority investment from WPCG, a financial services holding company, in July 2017. MAI acquired the wealth management division of Calfee Financial Advisors last year and the wealth management division of CCI Financial Group Inc. in April.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The acquisition closed on June 14, 2019 and will increase MAI\u2019s assets under management by over $400 million. Financial and legal terms of the deal were not disclosed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MAI Capital Management announces the acquisition of MTX Wealth Management, expanding
