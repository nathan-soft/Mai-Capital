The acquisition adds talent to MAI\u2019s financial planning and wealth teams at its headquarters in Independence, Ohio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based in Cleveland, Pareto provides financial planning and wealth management services for its high-net-worth clients. The firm\u2019s leaders Sean Kriak and Joe Palko work with clients to design comprehensive financial and retirement plans aligned with goals-based investment management and strategy. Pareto was previously a division of McDonald Partners Wealth Advisory Group in Cleveland. The entire Pareto team will join MAI, with Kriak and Palko each assuming the role of Managing Director at MAI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPartnering with professionals who share our client-first philosophy remains a priority for us as we grow,\u201d said Rick Buoncore, Managing Partner at MAI. \u201cSean and Joe exemplify this commitment and will be additive to MAI\u2019s larger financial planning and wealth management offerings. We\u2019re excited to welcome them aboard.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is MAI\u2019s eighth acquisition since Galway Holdings (\u201cGalway\u201d), a leading financial services distribution company, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.send2press.com\/wire\/galway-holdings-announces-formal-close-of-mai-capital-management-deal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">completed its acquisition<\/a> of MAI in September 2021. The partnership with Galway positions MAI for ongoing and strategic growth through M&amp;A and organic activity and broadens its client service offerings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, MAI announced its partnership with Intersect, a San Ramon, Calif.-based wealth management firm with a significant focus on advising professional athletes. Earlier this year, MAI announced its acquisition of Winfield Associates in Cleveland and Monarch Business &amp; Wealth Management in New York City. Prior to that, MAI acquired Investment Planning Associates located in Rockville, Maryland; Queens Oak Advisors in Charlotte, North Carolina; Hochman Cole Investment Advisors, based in the Chicagoland area; Storey &amp; Associates, located in North Canton, Ohio; HW Financial Advisors in Cleveland; the wealth management division of Ownership Advisors in Cleveland; MWM Investment Consulting located in Naples, Florida; and Geier Asset Management in Baltimore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur team\u2019s top focus is on delivering a superior client experience,\u201d said Kriak. \u201cPartnering with MAI will allow us to amplify these efforts, bringing expanded tools and resources for our clients, while affording us more time to focus on meeting our clients\u2019 goals and needs.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>John Hahn, Executive Chairman at Galway added: \u201cMAI\u2019s growth objectives are rooted in its mission to best serve its clients and fortify its team of quality and forward-thinking professionals. The addition of Sean, Joe and the Pareto team bolsters MAI\u2019s offerings within its Northeast Ohio headquarters and beyond.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The acquisition closed on Aug. 9, 2022 and financial and legal terms of the deal were not disclosed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to serve your specific financial needs through a relationship based on trust and by developing a customized strategy to grow and preserve your wealth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re here to answer any questions.
