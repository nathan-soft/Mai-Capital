For more than 50 years, one of the most frequently used divisions is growth versus value. But are investors really getting what they think they\u2019re getting when they buy into the Growth or Value camps? We suspect that most investors \u2014 and even some investment managers \u2014 are using old-fashioned notions of growth and value, and making investment decisions that might not stand up to the light of day (or, more important, to the pressure of a bear market).<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s value and growth definitions are confusing, to say the least: \u201cGrowth Stocks\u201d are growing, perhaps more quickly than the average company. But in different parts of the economic cycle, JP Morgan or Dow Chemical can grow their earnings faster than the market and both are classified as value stocks. Growth stocks are generally more expensive with higher P\/Es &#8212; justifiably so, their supporters would say, because you are \u201cpaying up for growth\u201d. But in a pandemic or just a slow economy, many stocks normally thought of as value stocks (e.g. financials, airlines, materials, energy) sell at high P\/Es as their earnings shrink. As we sit here today, Delta Airlines has a higher P\/E than Google. Which is the value stock?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our favorite example of the confusion of the value and growth labels is Apple. It is a huge, mature company (value), but growing quickly with market dominance in several areas like services and wearables (growth). It had a P\/E of 11 as recently as 2018 (value) but now has a P\/E of 28 (growth). It generally sells a hardware product (value), but its margins are way higher than the market\u2019s (growth). If you\u2019re confused, you\u2019re not alone \u2014 there are numerous value and growth mutual funds that all hold Apple stock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original definition of a \u201cvalue stock\u201d from the 1950s, was clear and based on accounting principles: An investor could derive the net worth of Company X by looking at its balance sheet assets and subtracting its liabilities. Then you would compare its net worth to the company\u2019s current stock market capitalization; if you could buy the stock for less than its net worth (per share), Company X was a \u201cvalue stock\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, though, there\u2019s one big problem. This formulation depends on the valuable assets of the company all being listed on the balance sheet, but increasingly, they\u2019re not. Companies aren\u2019t hiding them or committing fraud; it\u2019s just that assets are not as quantifiable as they used to be. The most important flaw in the value\/growth determination is that extremely valuable assets are not turning up on balance sheets anymore and that makes companies that have lots of valuable but non-balance-sheet assets look much more expensive than they really are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is critically important, and if you do not appreciate this, your investing will suffer in the 21st Century. A few examples can show how real value may be hiding in a growth disguise: Ford Motor Company creates a new car line and builds a $10 billion factory. Because the factory will last for decades, that investment goes on the balance sheet and value investors will find Ford stock $10 billion more attractive in the future. Contrast that with the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>Apple spends $10 billion on R&amp;D for the new Apple Watch. That investment is expensed (i.e., is shown as an expense on that year\u2019s income statement) and never appears on the balance sheet.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Disney creates The Lion King. It costs a lot to make (about $40 million), but it spawns a Broadway show, countless stuffed animals and a 2019 remake that alone grossed over $1.6 billion. Yet the original $40 million investment is nowhere on the balance sheet \u2014 and even if it were, it sure doesn\u2019t reflect the enormous value of The Lion King to Disney.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Google has a de facto monopoly on the search engine business, so much so that it has become a verb \u201cto google\u201d something. That is Google\u2019s \u201cfactory\u201d for selling advertisements. It is growing by leaps and bounds, and is much more profitable than Ford\u2019s new$10 billion factory, but it appears nowhere on Google\u2019s balance sheet.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In these examples, Ford looks like the attractive value stock according to the traditional definition. But you don\u2019t have to be a professional investor to appreciate this analysis misses the mark by a wide margin. How do you value research and development for Apple products, unique and enduring content for Disney, or Google\u2019s \u2018search factory\u2019? We can argue over the answer to these questions, but it is nonsensical to assign a value of zero to some of the most valuable assets in corporate America, and that\u2019s what a strict value investing analysis does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not that value investing is a discredited idea \u2013 the idea of determining a company\u2019s net worth and comparing it to its current market price remains the bedrock of good investing. Rather, it is the inputs to the net worth formula, based on old-fashioned assets, that need to be updated. The solution is for investors to sharpen their pencils and assign values to these intangible assets and then figure out if the companies that have these hidden assets are value investments. We don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel as we have tools that can help us model how much profit might come from the Apple Watch or Disney movies or Google\u2019s search engine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you don\u2019t appreciate that the world has changed \u2013 that often a company\u2019s most valuable assets don\u2019t even show up on the balance sheet \u2013 you run two risks. First, you could miss out investing in terrific companies that aren\u2019t that expensive when you factor in their intangible assets. Second, you run the risk of seeking shelter in what you perceive as inexpensive \u2018value\u2019 stocks that have attractive assets on their balance sheet, but little ability to make profits in a changed world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, we value the confidence you have placed in MAI to be your trusted advisor.
