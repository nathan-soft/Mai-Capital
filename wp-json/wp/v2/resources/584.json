Information based on 12\/31\/2020-12\/31\/2021. In order to be considered for the Forbes Top Financial Security Professional Ranking, applicants must meet the following methodology requirements: The Forbes Top Financial Security Professional Ranking, developed by SHOOK Research, is based on an algorithm of qualitative criterion, mostly gained through telephone and in-person due diligence interviews, and quantitative data. Those advisors that are considered have a minimum of seven years\u2019 experience, and the algorithm weighs factors like revenue trends, assets under management, compliance records, industry experience and those that encompass the highest standards of best practices. Portfolio performance is not a criterion due to varying client objectives and lack of audited data. Neither Forbes nor SHOOK receive a fee in exchange for rankings.
