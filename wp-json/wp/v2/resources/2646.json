For many, the dynamics associated with concentrated positions are complicated by both financial and emotional factors since the asset that created their wealth now represents the greatest risk to it. As with most aspects of financial planning, there is no single solution for managing concentrated positions that fits all circumstances. Rather, through an in-depth, holistic discovery process, it is important to identify a client\u2019s short- and long-term goals, risk tolerance, income and spending trends, tax situation, philanthropic desires, liquidity needs, etc., and then advise them on the most appropriate solution for their situation. In this edition of MAInsights, we will provide a brief synopsis of the primary solutions available to manage the risk associated with concentrated stock positions and then offer our initial thoughts on opportunity zones \u2013 the most recent entrant into the world of tax sheltered investments.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Primary Solutions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are a number of potential solutions for mitigating the investment and tax risk associated with concentrated positions, we would group them into the following four broad strategies: to sell, to hedge, to diversify and to donate. In the following table, we outline the implementation strategies within each category and the investor goals they are designed to achieve. In each case, there are pros and cons that must be weighed to deliver the optimal solution for the client.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"http:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/ConcentratedStock1-1024x627.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2654 lazyload\" width=\"847\" height=\"518\"\/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/ConcentratedStock1-1024x627.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2654 lazyload\" width=\"847\" height=\"518\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/ConcentratedStock1-1024x627.png 1024w, https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/ConcentratedStock1-300x184.png 300w, https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/ConcentratedStock1-768x470.png 768w, https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/ConcentratedStock1-1536x941.png 1536w, https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/ConcentratedStock1.png 1874w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px\" \/><\/noscript><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">*Option trading may entail significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors.

For investors who allocate to a Qualified Opportunity Fund, there are three potential tax benefits available:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>Deferral of a realized capital gain<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Step-up in tax basis of 10-15% if Opportunity Zone investment is held for 5-7 years<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Permanent exclusion of capital gain on Opportunity Zone investment if held for 10 years<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>A wide range of investments can be made in a Qualified Opportunity Fund including real estate and operating companies \u2013 to date, we have seen most Opportunity Funds focus on real estate development. A successful investment in an Opportunity Zone requires an attractive underlying investment opportunity coupled with compliance to a complex set of rules and regulations. Given the unique tax and investment implications of this new structure, we are approaching it with an elevated level of scrutiny and recommend that clients work closely with their wealth manager and tax adviser before pursuing an Opportunity Zone investment. More information on Opportunity Zones including frequently asked questions can be found on the IRS website at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.IRS.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/www.IRS.gov<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Concluding Thoughts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping clients navigate the myriad of potential solutions to a concentrated stock position is just one example of the holistic guidance we strive to deliver.
