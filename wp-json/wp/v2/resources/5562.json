They examine the top-heavy nature of the market, how rising interest rates have impacted the economy in the past, and what they expect to see happen down the road.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Current Market: Top Heavy &amp; Momentum<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is a positive that the market is up nicely this year, it is extremely top-heavy. At the end of June, the S&amp;P 500 Index was up about 16%, but if you take the biggest seven technology stocks out, the other 493 stocks were up only 4.5%. While the market can remain supported by \u201cGoldilocks\u201d conditions in the short term, our team is interested in looking at where the market is headed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where the Market is Heading<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To see where the market is heading, experts typically look to the past \u2013 which currently gives a less-than-optimistic outlook. To expect a soft landing down the road, you would have to bet against history with the thought that things will be different this time. The reason our team is hesitant to do that is, in some part, because of interest rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This chart highlights the rate tightening cycles since the mid-1980s, showing the current tightening cycle is both the highest and the fastest rate increase in 40 years.\u00a0With the lone exception of the 1994 rate hikes, the rest of these cycles were followed by recessions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"http:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Change-in-Fed-Funds.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5564 lazyload\"\/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"601\" height=\"282\" src=\"http:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Change-in-Fed-Funds.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5564 lazyload\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Change-in-Fed-Funds.png 601w, https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Change-in-Fed-Funds-300x141.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" \/><\/noscript><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">\u00a0Source: Evercore ISI (5\/21\/23)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forecasting a recession is never a sure thing, but reviewing historical data often allows us to better prepare for what may happen in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Do We Do Now?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t head for the hills yet! As mentioned previously, forecasts and predictions can be completely wrong. &nbsp;This economic moment is particularly unique given the pandemic impact and the enormous COVID stimulus that followed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if a recession is coming, it is difficult to predict when it will show up. In the meantime, the market is in a pretty good place, with inflation declining and the economy remaining solid. &nbsp;Instead of trying to time the recession, look to invest in quality companies that should come out of the other side of a recession in good shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind \u2013 even in recessions, there are bargains. Healthcare has been largely ignored, and we see compelling values there. In addition, some consumer goods companies rose during COVID and then fell, but look interesting again now. The goal here isn\u2019t to give stocks to buy, but to demonstrate that, even when the economy may take a downturn, there are almost always market segments that remain attractive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bottom line? Invest, but do it with your eyes open and keeping a long-term perspective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">If you have any questions related to this topic or your portfolio in general, please do not hesitate to reach out to your wealth advisor at any time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">Please send your questions, comments, and feedback to: info@mai.capital.
