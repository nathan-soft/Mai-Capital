We will most likely see a slow-motion downturn, especially in office space and multifamily spaces, and continue to see a structural housing shortage nationally.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Despite the recent events, the MAI team still sees opportunities in alternatives. The housing shortage could create value in affordable housing and the team sees additional opportunities in triple net real estate as well as private equity and venture capital investments.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As we continue to see a period of choppy markets ahead at the intersection of restrictive monetary policy and a weakening economy, we believe alternatives overall can continue to be a source of portfolio ballast, but there will be winners and losers.&nbsp; Discipline and diversification are imperative in the selection process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">If you have any questions related to this topic or your portfolio in general, please do not hesitate to reach out to your wealth advisor at any time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">Please send your questions, comments and feedback to: <a href=\"mailto:info@mai.capital\">info@mai.capital<\/a>.
