FA&#8217;s RIA ranking orders firms from largest to smallest, based on AUM reported to them by firms that voluntarily complete and submit FA&#8217;s survey by their deadline. Financial Advisor does its best to verify AUM by reviewing ADV forms. To be eligible for the ranking, firms must be independent registered investment advisors and file their own ADV statement with the SEC and provide financial planning and related services to individual clients. Firms must have at least $500 million in assets under management as of December 31, 2021 to be included in the print edition of Financial Advisor Magazine&#8217;s 2022 RIA survey. Firms with under $500 million will be included in FA&#8217;s expanded 2022 online RIA survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">Corporate RIA firms and investment advisor representatives (IARs) are not eligible for this survey. A corporate RIA is a registered investment advisor most often formed by a broker-dealer that files an ADV with the SEC. Advisors who are affiliated with the broker-dealer or other entity&#8217;s corporate RIA may offer investment advice. They are considered Investment Advisor Representatives (IARs) of the corporate RIA. All of the assets under management of the IARs are included in the corporate RIA&#8217;s ADV filed with the SEC.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>July 2022 \u2013 MAI Capital Management is thrilled to announce its ranking as 38th on Financial Advisor Magazine\u2019s RIA Survey &amp; Ranking list for 2022 in the $1billion and over asset category.
