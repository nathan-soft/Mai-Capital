Although we can&#8217;t predict elections, it&#8217;s interesting to study how the economy affects the way people vote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Economic &amp; Market Performance Impact Elections<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One economic factor has remained consistent for the past 110 &nbsp;years: If a recession starts within two years prior to election day, the standing president has not been reelected. The chart below shows that there have been 12 reelection attempts in the last 110 years when there has not been a recession.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Picture1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6799 lazyload\"\/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"483\" src=\"https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Picture1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6799 lazyload\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Picture1.jpg 625w, https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Picture1-300x232.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><\/noscript><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this chart tells the other side of the story. In the past, six leaders lost their reelection bids during a recession in their last two terms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Picture2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6800 lazyload\"\/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"483\" src=\"https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Picture2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6800 lazyload\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Picture2.jpg 625w, https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Picture2-300x232.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><\/noscript><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This might be a coincidence, but the recession rule is reliable and could be a sign for candidates to think about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Will There Be a Recession in 2024?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Picture3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6801 lazyload\"\/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"483\" src=\"https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Picture3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6801 lazyload\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Picture3.jpg 625w, https:\/\/mai.capital\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Picture3-300x232.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><\/noscript><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The chart above shows the history of the interest rate cycles over the past 40 years. Before the most recent series of <a href=\"https:\/\/mai.capital\/resources\/how-rising-interest-rates-impact-asset-allocation\/\">interest rate<\/a> hikes \u2013 the red line in the chart \u2013 there were five others. After four of the five, the economy slipped into recession within two years of the last hike, sometimes sooner. The most recent set of rate hikes and both the fastest and the highest of the group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is not certain, there is a relatively good chance a recession is a possibility next year. And based on the other historical trends we\u2019ve seen; this could shift the momentum of the incumbent\u2019s race.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Four Unique Points About the 2024 Election<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Elections are hard to predict, but there are interesting facts that make this upcoming race special.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Both the Republican and Democratic candidates, if it happens, will have been President before \u2013 a first since 1892. So, many voters will have a definite opinion about which is right for the job.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Both candidates will be older than any other major candidate.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This would be the first election where one major candidate is under indictment.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>There are several third-party candidates who could spell trouble for the incumbent. Those candidates could draw enough voters away to lose important states for him.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bottom Line?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>2024 could turn into a volatile and unpredictable year, so our team remains sure that the tried-and-true strategy of patience and discipline in the face of uncertainty is the best way to keep portfolios on track and achieve long-term goals.
